# Keyboard Test

This is the original test sketch I wrote to translate the signals from the 
console into keypresses for ETC Expression Offline edit.

While there is an offline editor for the microvision, (`etcedit`) it's an old
DOS program that only allows for editing a showfile directly and does not
"emulate" a console like modern "on PC" software.

The oldest console software that has this functionality and is relatively
similar to the microvisionFX is the next generation of 
Expression/Expression/Insight software.

You actually can use this program to have a "programming wing" for this
software--which surprisingly actually came in handy for a show--although
I doubt many people would need to do that lmao.
